### **Segmentation using Clustering and PCA**

**Course:** Machine Learning - 1  
**Date:** December 2023

#### **Project Overview**

This project focuses on leveraging data science techniques to segment digital marketing advertisements and analyze census data using advanced analytical methods. The primary goals are:

1. **Segmentation of Digital Marketing Advertisements:**
   - Utilize clustering techniques to group digital ads based on key performance metrics. The clustering aims to identify distinct segments of ads that exhibit similar characteristics, which can inform targeted marketing strategies and optimize ad performance.
   
2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on Census Data:**
   - Perform PCA to identify and analyze the principal components of a dataset derived from the Primary Census Abstract. The objective is to uncover the most significant components that explain the majority of the variance in the data, aiding in dimensionality reduction and deeper insights into demographic patterns.

#### **Skills & Tools Covered**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Perform initial data exploration to understand data structure, summary statistics, missing values, and data distributions.
  
- **Clustering:**
  - Implement clustering algorithms (e.g., K-means, Hierarchical) to segment data into homogeneous groups based on features such as CPM, CPC, and CTR in the digital ads dataset.
  
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
  - Apply PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify key components that capture the most variance in the census data.
  
- **Silhouette Score:**
  - Use silhouette scores to evaluate the quality of clusters and determine the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering.

- **Data Mining:**
  - Employ data mining techniques to extract meaningful patterns and insights from large datasets.

- **Segmentation:**
  - Apply segmentation techniques to categorize and analyze different segments of data for targeted marketing and strategic decision-making.

#### **Project Details**

1. **Digital Marketing Advertisement Data:**
   - **Objective:** Segment advertisements into groups using clustering algorithms based on metrics such as CPM (Cost Per Mille), CPC (Cost Per Click), and CTR (Click-Through Rate).
   - **Tasks:**
     - Perform EDA to clean and prepare the data.
     - Handle missing values and outliers.
     - Scale the data and apply clustering techniques.
     - Evaluate clustering performance using methods like Elbow Plot and Silhouette Scores.
     - Profile clusters to identify trends and characteristics.

2. **Primary Census Data:**
   - **Objective:** Use PCA to reduce dimensionality and identify principal components that explain the most variance in the census data.
   - **Tasks:**
     - Conduct EDA to understand the data and its features.
     - Apply PCA to the scaled dataset.
     - Determine the number of principal components that capture the most variance.
     - Analyze the principal components to understand their significance and impact.

#### **Expected Outcomes**

- **For Digital Marketing Ads:**
  - Identification of distinct ad segments that can be targeted with tailored strategies.
  - Insights into performance metrics and effectiveness of different ad types.

- **For Census Data:**
  - Reduction of data dimensions while retaining key variance-explaining components.
  - Enhanced understanding of demographic patterns and trends.
